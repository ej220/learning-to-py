# learning-to-py
Repo to drop random scripts, lesson workbooks, and programs in whilst learning to Py.

### automate-the-boring-stuff

Contains the workbooks I used to follow along the well known Udemy course that follows the well known book, of same title.

### hangman

First game! Contains a hangman game. It's really scrappy, and I got pretty loosey-goosey with global variables...

### noughts-and-crosses

Second game! OK, I think I've made definite progress since the first game. Not a global variable in sight, I'm using fstrings instead of string concatination, and no more ridiculous levels of indentation (mostly...), but A LOT of passing local variables between function blocks. Time to work out how to use classes and create objects... Also some real scrappy brute-forced code for the computer-players "inteligence"...
